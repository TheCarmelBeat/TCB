        <h2 class="text-center">So you cut your hair with the kitchen scissors. Oh no.

        </h2>
        <br><br><br>
                <p class="para">
                  
                  In the grand chronicle of questionable decisions made during
                  moments of stress, the saga of your impromptu bang-trimming
                  session with the kitchen scissors stands out as a testament to the
                  lengths you will go for a semblance of control. There you were, on
                  a soul-stormy Tuesday, staring into the mirror and thinking, “Yes,
                  bangs are the missing piece to my life puzzle.” And not just any
                  bangs, but the kind you see on effortlessly chic individuals who
                  drink black coffee and read philosophy for fun. 

                  <br><br>
                  Armed only with determination and scissors better suited for
                  wrestling open pasta packages, you dove into this follicular (that
                  sounded needlessly disgusting) journey. The first snip was thrilling, a bold claim of independence in an unpredictable world. Yet,
                  by the third snip, as hair piled up on the floor like confetti after a
                  wild party, you realized your inner stylist might have been overly
                  optimistic. The mirror now reflected less of a ‘Parisian philosopher’
                  and more ‘craft project by a particularly enthusiastic six-year-old.’
                   <br><br>
                   You feel the laughter bubbling up. You can suddenly relate to
                  Claire from Fleabag (“I LOOK LIKE A PENCIL!!”). Frankly
                  speaking, life sucked. But god, anything was better than the current mop on your head. Despite the mishap, grabbing a hat to hide
                  your daring do (and to avoid your best friend’s inevitable horror),
                  you couldn’t help but find joy in the chaos. This impulsive makeover was a wild grab for control, but it taught you the beauty of
                  letting go and embracing life’s unpredictable moments. And really,
                  isn’t the point of having control over your life knowing when to let
                  go and find humor in the chaos? Because it’s fine. Your hair will
                  grow back. Maybe this is the sign you needed to go bald.
                   <br><br>
                   The brand-new Carmel Archives, version 2020 does not boast any ancient artifacts,
                    rare manuscripts, or any of that kind. But it does have ample old photographs and 
                    journals of students and staff and their contributions. There are several articles 
                    and heartfelt poems from those studying here 20-30 years ago, and when we brushed 
                    through them, we felt the relatableness to surely exist today too. The old typewriters, 
                    the grand piano, the old Convent nun uniform which is strikingly similar to that from the
                     movies, and even the random rocks in the commerce section may be items you have never 
                     seen before, other than on the internet.
                   <br><br>
                   Later, calling your best friend only to have her hang up at the
                  sight of your new ‘do? Priceless.
                  <br><br>
                  And then, you hear the lock of the front door click. Your parents
                  are home.
                  <br><br>
                   Oh no.
