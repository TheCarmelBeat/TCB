                        It was nearing late afternoon and our whole team was excited. And why wouldn’t we be, we were
                        interviewing none other than the Vixens Crew! The group of seven fierce women, who took the
                        dance scene by storm, are truly a force to reckon with. Too busy being trendsetters and an
                        inspiration to many, they still made time to chat with us and the energy throughout was nothing
                        short of electric.

                        conquer the dance floor. The room buzzed with excitement, a mix of intimidation, awe and pure
                        admiration. Medha, Anushka, Vibha, Megha, Bhavana, Ketaki, Renee, collectively known as
                        The Vixens, exuded power and camaraderie.

                        collaborations with bigger artists and the invaluable lessons learned in 2023.

                        &quot;At the end of the day, we are doing something that we love,&quot; Bhavana shared, emphasising

                        The conversation shifted to their creative process, and it became clear that Vixens are more

                        explaining how they infuse their unique style into every routine, refusing to be confined by
                        existing norms.

                        When we touched upon the topic of the landscape of social media and the pressure that comes
                        with it, the crew agreed that staying true to themselves is the key. The digital world is a space
                        where demands are endless and conformity is valued, but as Anushka tells us,, “We focus on
                        the positive comments. It&#39;s good pressure, not something negative.&quot;

                        a surprise collaboration with Dulquer Salmaan, the famous Indian actor and playback singer.
                        Their excitement was contagious and the recounting of the surreal experience left all of us in
                        smiles.

                        plans for more collaborations, travel and performances. There was one word that encapsulated
                        their vision: &quot;Grateful.&quot; We could feel it in their voices that they were grateful for the journey, the
                        support and the opportunity to inspire through dance.

                        Kirti Sushant Pai, a master practitioner of graphology at Global Penmanship Academy and a
                        member of the International Council of Graphologists, delves into analysing handwriting to
                        understand personality traits. Her journey with graphology began with curiosity but soon grew
                        into a profound tool for self-awareness and personal development under the mentorship of Imran
                        Baig Sir.

                        Pai, an MCC alumnus, always found herself interested in working with children, however in the
                        end, she moved forward with pursuing sciences until graduation. Years after becoming a
                        homemaker, she found a new passion in graphology.

                    <p class="para">
                        She describes graphology as the study of handwriting to gain insights into someone’s
                        personality. By analyzing handwriting elements like size, slant and pressure, one can gain
                        valuable insights into strengths, weaknesses and behavioural patterns. For Pai, graphology isn’t
                        just about personality assessment; it’s about empowering individuals. She uses graphotherapy, a
                        technique involving handwriting analysis and correction, to help clients understand their thinking
                        patterns and improve their handwriting. This, she believes, empowers the brain and fosters
                        overall well-being.

                        writing. Encouraging youngsters to write regularly is her way of advocating for brain health. For
                        those considering graphology as a career path, Pai offers enthusiastic encouragement. She
                        highlights the diverse applications of graphology, including signature analysis, children’s
                        programs, and graphotherapy..
