                        It was nearing late afternoon and our whole team was excited. And why wouldn’t we be, we were
                        interviewing none other than the Vixens Crew! The group of seven fierce women, who took the
                        dance scene by storm, are truly a force to reckon with. Too busy being trendsetters and an
                        inspiration to many, they still made time to chat with us and the energy throughout was nothing
                        short of electric.

                        As they entered the room, it felt like a burst of energy, a powerful army of women ready to
                        conquer the dance floor. The room buzzed with excitement, a mix of intimidation, awe and pure
                        admiration. Medha, Anushka, Vibha, Megha, Bhavana, Ketaki, Renee, collectively known as
                        The Vixens, exuded power and camaraderie.

                        Amidst laughter and banter, we delved into their world, discovering the essence of their journey.
                        Recently celebrating their one-year anniversary, The Vixens Crew is filled with anticipation for
                        the exciting journey ahead.

                        <br>
                            A: All my teachers and the staff were very supportive. They never excluded me, instead, 
                            they were protective of me. That really helped me get through my 2 years of college. They pampered me a lot. I’m still in touch 
                            with my teachers.

                            A:  It was good! The course had various departments come to teach us – Journalism, Economics, Political Science, etc. 
                            It gave me opportunities to do field work and exposure. Plus the student council did a very 
                            good job. I really liked the atmosphere, it gave me a good feeling.
