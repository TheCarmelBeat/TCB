                      The Department of English hosted its annual inter-college fest ‘Amatora’ on
                       Jan. 19. Themed ‘Kairos’, the fest was dedicated to fostering creativity without boundaries. Originally called ‘Apostrophe’ in 2013, the fest was renamed ‘Amatora’ last year. 


                      
                      <br><br>
                      Amatora has consistently remained a fest that prioritises literary knowledge and appreciation even with events. True to its identity as a literature fest, the events at Amatora 
                      revolved around the English language. Students from Dayanand Sagar, Jain University, St Joseph’s University, St Claret’s University and PES University were among the many participants. 
                      The events ranged from ‘Voice your Verses’, a slam poetry event for participants to showcase their poetic talents, and an improv event ‘To Be Continued…’ inviting teams of four to write a
                       story together to ‘Words Wage War’ brought forth a clash of ideas by inviting contestants to debate their stances, and ‘Coffee with Carmel’, hosted by the Literary Association, brought 
                       contests like rapid fire, a literary quiz and Pictionary.                                             
                       <br><br>
                       “It was really good, we enjoyed the performances. It was a fun experience to perform,” said Rakshith, a 2nd-year B.Tech. student from PES University who participated in the slam poetry event.

                        <br><br>
                        The rolling trophy for contingents was won by Jain Deemed-to-be-University, while the English Department’s rolling trophy was won by 1st MA English. 
                        2nd BA English Psychology and 1st BA English Psychology placed second and third respectively.

                    The annual humanities fest presented ‘Kairos; A cabinet of Curiosities’ this year, a theme celebrating the complexities and the individuality
                     of each person. The fest was conducted across 2 shifts on Jan. 19. 



                  <br><br>
                  The inaugural ceremony started with the college song, a rendition of ‘million dreams’ by the WMA, and dance performances by IDA 
                   and the Kannada Sangha. The chief guest; Vasundhara Das, sang a beautiful hindi piece from the movie ‘Jaane Tu ya Jaane Na’ and conveyed
                    her gratitude to her Alma mater, fondly remembering Sr Genevieve. This was followed by a powerful speech by the keynote speaker, Dr Akkai Padmashali, 
                    a transgender activist. 


                   <br><br>
                   The fest witnessed events that explored talent showcasing from each of the 14 associations across different locations in the campus.
                    <br><br>
                    While the Political Science Association organized Democracy 4 where students took on role playing characters to solve crises,
                     Psychology Association’s Mood Mela took the students on an emotions ride.  The Communication Club, and the Tourism Association dabbled in fictional world building events, keeping up to the theme. 

                     <br><br>
                     The Humanities Association's event ‘And then there were none' in the second half featured a murder mystery, engaging participants to investigate the case and find the real criminal.
                      ‘Goblet Of Graphics’ by the Artha Association and ‘Illogical nights’ by the History Association were some of the other afternoon events.

              Academicia, a fest for eco-conscious academics, took place on Jan. 11, 2024. Academicia kickstarted the new year in the festing 
              circle with a bang. In the heart of academic fervour and creative enthusiasm, the fest unfolded its vibrant mosaic with the theme 
              "Mindful Horizons: Interdisciplinary Dialogues on a Sustainable Future." This also marked the first intercollegiate fest of the year 2024.
               The campus was bustling with activity as other college students also participated in the events. 

             <br><br>
             The fest commenced with an inauguration that set the tone for the events’ overarching theme. Esteemed speakers from diverse fields shared insights 
             on the importance of interdisciplinary dialogues in shaping a sustainable future. The various events held by different associations followed through
              with the same. This time, events were held in collaboration with other associations rather than a single association. The Psychology and Journalism
               Associations hosted an event resembling Shark Tank, while the Kannada Sangha, LitSoc, French, German and Sanskrit Associations came together to test
                the crowd’s linguistic prowess. Stalls of several varieties were set up in the amphitheatre. 


               <br><br>
               As the curtains closed for Academicia, it can’t be denied that the fest had provided a platform that sowed the seeds of much-needed sustainable awareness. The spirit of Mindful Horizons had ignited a flame—a beacon guiding the way towards a more conscious, interconnected and sustainable future.

            <br><br>
            There can be only one word used to describe someone who tends to forget her age but instantly remembers every moment of the place she worked at - loyal. A six-decade allegiance
             to Mount Carmel College has made Govinda Amma nothing short of a fascinating, dedicated person, who continues to serve MCC for more than 58 years. 
            <br><br>
            Starting her long journey as a convent assistant under the late Dr. Sister Genevieve, who was known for her generous nature, Amma has transitioned to working under the canteen (Triple C) maintenance head, Babu who works at the canteen’s fifth counter. Amma’s daughter works for the college as an attendant and her granddaughter formerly worked for the college too. 

            <br><br>
            A native of Tamil Nadu, Amma resides in Bengaluru’s Lingarajpuram area which is around 6-7 km away from the college. However, there are days when she does not go back home and instead opts to stay around the college area.  She reasons her decision by stating that her home tends to be very far away and her poor financial situation does not allow her to travel comfortably, so she rather stay close and come back in the morning to do her work. 
             <br><br>
             Unfortunately, Amma, who is lonely and feels abandoned, is viewed to be mentally ‘unfit’ for speaking to herself when she is sitting all alone. Despite her advanced age and poor health, she finds it extremely difficult to leave MCC because of her love, effort, and dedication.
