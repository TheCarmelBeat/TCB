                      The Department of English organized its first-ever international conference on Feb. 22 and 23, themed ‘Uncanny Explorations’. 
                      Organized in hybrid mode, it was a multi-disciplinary conference on ‘delineating the borders of the uncanny’. The conference 
                      attempted to unravel and interpret the uncanny and review the existing order of society.


                      
                      <br><br>
                      In an effort to capture the essence of this academic venture, Carmel Beat engaged in interviews with three members of the
                       Organising Committee from the Department of English: Dr. Sreevidya Surendran, Dr. Mamatha V Freeman and Dr. Aditi Chatterjee.
                        Their insights revealed the ambition behind the conference: to establish it as an annual highlight, showcasing MCC's intellectual 
                        contributions alongside its celebrated cultural events.

                       The planning phase, initiated in July 2023, was charged with enthusiasm seen through vibrant theme selections, task assignments and
                        collaboration with partners and sponsors, setting the stage for an exceptional event. With the participation of over 50 presenters and 70 attendees, 
                        the conference aimed to push boundaries, thanks to the relentless efforts of students, teachers and particularly the tech team, who expertly managed 
                        its hybrid format, ensuring a seamlessly executed and memorable conference.

                    White Summerland, widely recognised by MCC as the pre-Cul-Ah event, took place on January 27 amidst excitement, energy,
                     and the presence of brilliant musicians. 



                  <br><br>
                  The event began with a live performance by the band "Barfi," which quickly piqued the audience's interest.
                   Their incredible beats and mesmerising tunes set the tone for the evening, putting everyone on their feet and eager to dance.

                   
                   <br><br>
                   As the night followed, the line-up showcased various genres and music styles with DJ Ravator, DJ Shanaya and DJ Prithvi,
                    each artist brought their unique sound and personality to the stage. The crowd cheered and applauded as the artists took their spot on the stage. The atmosphere became charged with an adrenaline-fueled excitement. 
                    
                     
                    <br><br>
                    The art and decor team created a visually magnificent background for the evening by artistically decorating the campus. The surroundings were embellished with 
                    exquisite details and beautiful touches, creating a wonderful atmosphere that enveloped every corner. Attendees dressed in various hues of white, which 
                    complimented the decor and contributed to the event's ethereal mood.

               Cul-ah 2024 was declared open by the honourable chief guest, Meenakshi Byre and the Student Council. 
               The gathering was then addressed by Dr. Tarsh Thekaekara who explained the motive behind the theme ‘Hear Me Roar’
                and our collaboration with the WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature) as the college aimed towards creating awareness 
                for animal conservation and an understanding of our biodiversity.

                        <br><br>
            Situated at Vasanth Nagar’s third cross, Soul Salon is a luxurious women’s parlour on the ground floor of a white, three-story building.
            Mary, the sole owner of Soul Salon for eight years, has overseen its remarkable growth. Expanding citywide, Soul Salon now operates branches in Sahakar
            Nagar and Rajajinagar. As a proud woman entrepreneur, she also brings in her expertise as a skilled beautician, hairdresser,
            and makeup artist.


          <br><br>
          Soul, like every other salon, offers a wide range of services to their diverse clientele. Their eyebrow-shaping service starts at an unbelievable 40 rupees,
          making Soul Salon a standout in affordability. Basic haircuts beginning at just 400 rupees further solidify their reputation as the most wallet-friendly
          pick. With a continuous stream of regular clients and a daily footfall of 20 to 30 consumers, they mostly see college students
          come in for brow shaping and upper lip threading. 


            
          <br><br>
          They pride themselves over not recommending unneeded procedures. Soul Salon’s principle is simple:
          prioritise regular clientele above daily income, with an emphasis on regular customer flow. When asked what
          makes them stand out, Devi Chhetri, originally from Darjeeling and leading her team of five
          for seven years now, modestly chuckles and simply says, “That I don’t know, but we’re doing good only.” However, she
          proudly claims that they’re the most budget-friendly option on Loafers Lane, a reassuring fact
          for the students living there.

                     Held in the DJB Auditorium, the seminar looked into how the aspirants should prepare for the exams and what courses 
                     are offered at Rau’s to help them. Mr Ankur Sharma from Rau’s established that early preparation would be their key to success. 
                     After this, the students also wrote a scholarship test organised for them.
